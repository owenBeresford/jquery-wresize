jquery-wresize
==============

Plugin to collapse window resize events.  Please see other readme.

Why are there no unit tests?
I published early... If I get time I will create a set of qunit tests.

In terms of behat or jasmine, because that would require installing software on external machines where I am not admin.  I only //need// unittests for MSIE and Safari.
